Sexy Slider to protect your blog against spam.

== Description ==

My aim was it to build an anti-spam captcha which just look awesome and people have fun to use it. Not like these stupid and annoying "What-is-2-plus-3" ones. Founding an iPhone-like slider at <a href="http://www.aboone.com/javascript-iphone-lock-slider-with-jquery">Aboone</a> which is just what I've searched for, I starteted to work. With this plugin you have the possibility to add a <b>sexy slider</b> to your comments, which mark all comments as spam, if you haven't use the slider before. Hope you enjoy it!

This is my <b>first plugin</b>, so I will be very thankful if I get feedback!

= How can I edit the slider? =

Go to the AdminMenu "Slide2Comment" and edit your CSS there.

Alternative - override these CSS Elements:

		<style type="text/css"> 
			.track-center{
				background-image: url(<?=$path ?>track.png);
				height: 45px;
				margin: 0px 10px;
			}

			.track-left{
				width: 10px;
				height: 45px;
				float: left;
				background-image: url(<?=$path ?>trackleft.png);
			}

			.track-right{
				width: 10px;
				height: 45px;
				float: right;
				background-image: url(<?=$path ?>trackright.png);
			}

			.track-message{
				color:white;
				font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;
				font-size:24px;
				padding:9px 18px;
				text-align:right;
			}

			.handle{
				background-image: url(<?=$path ?>handles.png);
